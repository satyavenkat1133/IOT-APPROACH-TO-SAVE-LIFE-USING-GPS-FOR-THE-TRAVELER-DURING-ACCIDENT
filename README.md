# IOT-APPROACH-TO-SAVE-LIFE-USING-GPS-FOR-THE-TRAVELER-DURING-ACCIDENT
Vehicle accident detection system
This project aims to save life of the traveler during accident in the remote area. Thousands of people 
lost their valuable life in vehicle accidents every day due to the traffic, Road condition and speed. By 
using GPS antenna and latest technological concept of IOT, accident can be immediately reported, 
reduced and human life can be saved, by connecting different kinds of sensors to different parts or 
positions of vehicle. In-tern by making these sensors to communicate with the hospital or ambulance 
immediate treatment can be given to the injured person during accident. In this paper, we have 
designed and implemented by connecting to different sensors to vehicle, which notifies the registered 
members whenever accident takes place. Using GPS exact geographic location will be sent to 
registered user. In this proposed system tilt sensor is used to detect the accident caused due to tilting, 
Vibration sensor to detects the accident if there is a hard vibration of vehicle due to road condition.
